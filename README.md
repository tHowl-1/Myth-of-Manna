# Myth-of-Manna
A simple libtcod project to learn about managing a large project.

The goal of this project was to learn about how to organize large object oriented projects and to gain practice coding in c++. Ultimately, I think all around some parts of the code are rough and could use more work but I have learned a lot since starting about what to do and what not to do.

Here are a few pictures showing variation in world map generation featuring different biomes and heights using layered noisemaps
![WorldGen](/pics/world1.png?raw = true "An example of world generation")
![WorldGen](/pics/world2.png?raw = true "An example of world generation")
![WorldGen](/pics/world3.png?raw = true "An example of world generation")

Includes basic world generation, movement, collisions, and action handling for a simple roguelike. dditionally, entity interactions are handled using a component and event system. Rendering is handled using libtcod and prints ascii characters onto the console. The game also features a newly added inventory system.

Each character

![BiomeGen](/pics/rocky.png?raw = true "An example of biome generation")
![BiomeGen](/pics/jungle+inventory.png?raw = true "An example of biome generation")
